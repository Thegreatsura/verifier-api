# üìÑ Payment Verification API

This API provides verification services for payment transactions made through **Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)**, **Telebirr**, **Dashen Bank**, **Bank of Abyssinia**, and **CBE Birr** mobile payment platforms in Ethiopia.  
It allows applications to verify the authenticity and details of payment receipts by reference numbers or uploaded images.

## üåê Hosting Limitations for `verify-telebirr`

Due to **regional restrictions** by the Telebirr system, hosting the `verify-telebirr` endpoint outside of Ethiopia (e.g., on a VPS like Hetzner or AWS) may result in failed receipt verification. Specifically:

- Telebirr‚Äôs receipt pages (`https://transactioninfo.ethiotelecom.et/receipt/[REFERENCE]`) often **block or timeout** requests made from foreign IP addresses.
- This results in errors such as `ERR_FAILED`, `403`, or DNS resolution failures.

### ‚ùå Affected:

- VPS or cloud servers located outside Ethiopia

### ‚úÖ Works Best On:

- Ethiopian-hosted servers (e.g., Ethio Telecom web hosting, TeleCloud VPS)
- Developers self-hosting the code on infrastructure based in Ethiopia

#### üõ† Proxy Support:

This project includes a secondary Telebirr verification relay hosted inside Ethiopia. When the primary `verify-telebirr` fetch fails on your foreign VPS, the server can **fallback to our proxy** to complete the verification.

For best results and full control, clone the repository and **self-host from inside Ethiopia**.

---

### üîÅ Skip Primary Verifier (For VPS Users)

If you know your environment cannot access the primary endpoint, set the following in your `.env`:

```env
SKIP_PRIMARY_VERIFICATION=true
```

This will skip the primary Telebirr receipt fetch entirely and go straight to the fallback proxy ‚Äî only for your local use case. Other users can still benefit from both layers.
